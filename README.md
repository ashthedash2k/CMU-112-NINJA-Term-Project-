# CMU-112-NINJA-Term-Project-
My term project for CMU 15-112! A rendition of the game Fruit Ninja, written in python with the help of Tkinter : )

A short description of the project's name and what it does. This may be taken from your design docs.

How to run the project. For example, which file the user should run in an editor. If your project uses data/source files, also describe how the user should set those up.

Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!
