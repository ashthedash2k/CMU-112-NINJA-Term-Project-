# CMU-112-NINJA-Term-Project-
My term project for CMU 15-112! A rendition of the game Fruit Ninja, written in python with the help of Tkinter : )

<h3>Description!</h3>
This is my term project for CMU 15-112. Its called CMU 112 NINJA, and its a rendition of the game Fruit Ninja. Its written in Python with the help of CMU-112 graphics library (which uses PIL and Tkinter).

The goal of CMU 112 NINJA is to slash the flying circles on the screen to get points. If you don't slash a circle, you lose a life (you have only 3!), or if you hit a bomb, the game is over :/ Users can swipe multiple circles at a time to get combos. As time passes, the randomness of the bombs and circles increase, as well as the speed at which they fly into the sky. Motion is generated with accurate physics too!

<h3>Set up!</h3>
To run CMU 112 Ninja, save the CMU-112 graphics library, images folder, score.txt file, and main.py in the same directory. You just need to run main.py to play. To navigate, press the h key to get instructions, the e key to go home, and the p key to play. If you want to play another round, close the program and run it again, your highscores will be saved (unless you decide to reset the score.txt file).

<h3>Dependencies!</h3>
To allow the graphics library to run, pip install requests, PIL, and tkinter. More in depth instructions can be found on the CMU 112 website: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-graphics.html#installingModules
